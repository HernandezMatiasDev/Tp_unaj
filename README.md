An integrative work from the first year of UNAJ.
This had to have a menu to interact with.
I tried to make a simulation of the 100 prisoners' dilemma.
It is a probability problem where each prisoner must find his number in 50 attempts within 100 squares. The key is to follow a strategy based on cycles that significantly increases the probability of collective success (around 31%) instead of searching randomly (percentage of success by chance is 0.5 raised to the 100th power.
